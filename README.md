# Zenlib

Zenlib is a simple library management system for cataloging books and other media, and tracking loans of the media to library patrons.

It is designed for relatively small libraries for which existing library management solutions would be too complex to implement.

Zenlib is written in PHP and uses SQLite as its database.
